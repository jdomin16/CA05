This assignment will teach you how to create a Logistic Regression model in order to predict which patients are at risk or not of cardiovascular disease. The assignment consist of 3 different parts. The first step is to create a binary classifier using logistic regression to be able to predict if the patient is at risk or not. The second step is to look closer at the importance of the different features in the dataset. Lastly, is to create an ROC curve and look at the AUC of the model.
